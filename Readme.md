1.	This program is developed under Eclipse EE environment using JAVA 1.8
2.	To execute the program under command line, use the command “java Main”
3.	Programs are pre-compiled, therefore compilation is not necessary.
4.	Once the program executes a series of menu will be loaded on the screen
5.	Based on the user selection further navigation and execution will be carried out.
6.	It is understood that user guides through ascending order of the menu because each menu operation are closely bonded with next set of actions.
7.	Exceptions are handled therefore if user tries to key in illegal characters other than menu number the application will throw an error.
8.	At menu number 8 the application further extends to accept bin capacity from user. This input should also be in integer, any character input may result in exception at run time.
9.	To exit the application user can press 9 at the menu, this will immediately terminate the application.
10.	Test cases are written under test package therefore change in code or resource files may lead to violation of test cases.
